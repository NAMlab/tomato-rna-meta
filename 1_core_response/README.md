An easy thing to do is STRING P-P interactions
Interpro could be very helpful for gene families, but it uses UniProt IDs (and doesn't recognize my gene IDs)
UniProt has an ID mapper but I don't know what source DB to choose; when I search for my gene IDs it finds them (as Gramene IDs) but Gramene does not seem to be an option for the mapper.
- one option is to download the Gramene Biomart Gene ID -> UniParc ID and then at UniProt UniParc -> UniProtKB
